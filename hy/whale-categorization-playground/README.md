## Data description
This training data contains thousands of images of jumpback whale flukes. Individual whales have been identified by researchers and given an `Id`. The challenge is to predict the whale `Id` of images in the test set.


## File descriptions
 * train.zip : a floder containing the training images
 * train.csv : maps the training `Image` to the appropriate whale `Id`. Whales that are not predicted to have a label identified in the training data should be labeled as `new_whale`.
 * test.zip : a folder containing the test images to predict the whale `Id`
 * sample_submission.csv : a smaple submission file in the correct format
